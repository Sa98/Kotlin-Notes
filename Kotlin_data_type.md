- Declaring variable in Kotlin
```
var testVariable: String = "Value of the variable"
```

- `val` is just like const in javascript, you cannot reassign/change it 

```
val Pi: Double = "3.14"
```

- Type inference: we don't always have to state the type.However you can not assign it to different type of value later.

```
variable testVariable = "test"
```
